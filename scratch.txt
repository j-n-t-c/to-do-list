TODAY

sort by??? don't try until after you push to git and set up a new reference file

center project X

hover/showcompleted button/ style a bit more

figure out why objArray builds up - maybe link to storage

rewrite default projects/tasks to give instructions

"fixed most bugs, objArray still accumulating oddly on init, added custon warning popups, updated styles with more icons"


                //clean up code
            



LATER
only display show/hide completed tasks if there are completed tasks
new task button within project and global
change deleting tasks from deleted project to a prompt, not alert - need to make custom popup
collapse tasks
default display or warning if everything is deleted

clean up code spacing/tabs

    create separate functions for template listeners -- too much repetition

separate submitandupdate

separate match and delete methods

separate clear functions (project and task)

//i think this is ok// might be something stemming from createprojectarray, the dom id doesn't exist, check it out

write this more clearly
KNOWN PROBLEMS:
1. when all completed are hidden, except one, if one is unchecked, all become unhidden, not just in that project

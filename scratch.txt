TODAY


something fucked up with completed check toggling again when adding new tasks in new projects - hides when it shouldnet

redesign task wrapper and project wrapper layout
collapse/expand notes in each task

when same task name added, pop up dialog shouldn't close, should let you enter new task name without having to open new task again

"fixed broken things, broke more things, added add tasks to individual project headers"




                //clean up code
            



LATER
only display show/hide completed tasks if there are completed tasks
new task button within project and global
change deleting tasks from deleted project to a prompt, not alert - need to make custom popup
collapse tasks
default display or warning if everything is deleted

clean up code spacing/tabs

    create separate functions for template listeners -- too much repetition

separate submitandupdate

separate match and delete methods

separate clear functions (project and task)

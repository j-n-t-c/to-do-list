TODAY
wrapperArray in hideCmpInProject can go missing after random clicking god damnit
ok it's when completed tasks are hidden and you mark another task completed, it hides all em


"changed page style, added new divs to templates so open/completed tasks are separate, fixed all the things that broke"

if all tasks are hidden, display something

check for this:           AND when i went to delete a task after playing with completed/hide, threw error and fucked up display
made hide buttons to hide completed tasks in indiviudal projects and globally



                //clean up code
            



LATER
only display show/hide completed tasks if there are completed tasks
new task button within project and global
change deleting tasks from deleted project to a prompt, not alert - need to make custom popup
collapse tasks
default display or warning if everything is deleted

clean up code spacing/tabs

    create separate functions for template listeners -- too much repetition

separate submitandupdate

separate match and delete methods

separate clear functions (project and task)

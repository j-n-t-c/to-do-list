TODAY

"added ability to hide all completed tasks globally or by individual project, more work to be done in scratch.txt"

if all tasks are hidden, display something

check for this:           AND when i went to delete a task after playing with completed/hide, threw error and fucked up display
made hide buttons to hide completed tasks in indiviudal projects and globally



                //clean up code
            



LATER

new task button within project and global
change deleting tasks from deleted project to a prompt, not alert - need to make custom popup
collapse tasks
default display or warning if everything is deleted
button to hide completed tasks

clean up code spacing/tabs

    create separate functions for template listeners -- too much repetition

separate submitandupdate

separate match and delete methods

separate clear functions (project and task)

SEPARATE DOM TO MODULE
render, elements, etc
        //maybe make a general page init function to handle both inits idk

TODAY

check out why error throwing after fixed priorityColor/hideshow
style expanded notes div


BIG PROBLEM - something fucky going on with arrays when entire project deleted
now project delete buttons not working at all.... something fucky with first item always


when same task name added, pop up dialog shouldn't close, should let you enter new task name without having to open new task again

might be something stemming from createprojectarray, the dom id doesn't exist, check it out

"fixed task delete issue by rewriting foreach into filter(), fixed priority color, still needs some features added and styling but done for today"


                //clean up code
            



LATER
only display show/hide completed tasks if there are completed tasks
new task button within project and global
change deleting tasks from deleted project to a prompt, not alert - need to make custom popup
collapse tasks
default display or warning if everything is deleted

clean up code spacing/tabs

    create separate functions for template listeners -- too much repetition

separate submitandupdate

separate match and delete methods

separate clear functions (project and task)

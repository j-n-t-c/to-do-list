TODAY


when coloring priorities, can't hide/unhide cuz it's trying to read style of hidden
can't add new tasks now

expand doesn't work on completed projects


BIG PROBLEM - something fucky going on with arrays when entire project deleted
now project delete buttons not working at all.... something fucky with first item always


when same task name added, pop up dialog shouldn't close, should let you enter new task name without having to open new task again

might be something stemming from createprojectarray, the dom id doesn't exist, check it out

"backup, almost done with layout/design, still fixing and breaking things constantly but getting there"


                //clean up code
            



LATER
only display show/hide completed tasks if there are completed tasks
new task button within project and global
change deleting tasks from deleted project to a prompt, not alert - need to make custom popup
collapse tasks
default display or warning if everything is deleted

clean up code spacing/tabs

    create separate functions for template listeners -- too much repetition

separate submitandupdate

separate match and delete methods

separate clear functions (project and task)

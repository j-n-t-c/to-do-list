see if possible to arrange order of tasks on page

if project name already exists, prompt to change

dropdown list to select project from projects array

separate submitandupdate

if project empty, put something in display

projects get added kind of fucky for example 'my tasks' gets put in as "project-my tasks" maybe regex or something on value input
to correct, worryabout it later

separate match and delete methods

separate clear functions (project and task)

change deleting tasks from deleted project to a prompt, not alert
